feat: Add drag-and-drop studio with hot reload support

COMPLETED SINCE LAST COMMIT (7c18245):
- Added new Drag & Drop Studio page (/studio) for visual layout prototyping with palette blocks and workspace drop zone
- Integrated drag-and-drop event handlers with live status message updates
- Created design palette with 4 block types (Champion, Items, Matchup, Perks) as prototyping templates
- Extended CSS styling with studio-specific classes for palette items, workspace zones, and responsive grid layout
- Enabled Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components namespace in _Imports.razor to make PageTitle and NavLink components available
- Added NavLink for /studio route in NavMenu for easy access to the new design studio
- Updated README.md with UI Development Workflow section explaining dotnet watch and hot reload workflow
- Blazor WebAssembly project builds successfully with no compilation errors
- Studio.razor page compiles and is ready for hot reload testing in the browser

NOT YET DONE (BLOCKING ISSUES - PICK UP HERE NEXT):

1. Terminal/PowerShell Session Issue:
   Previous attempts to format .gitignore via Python/PowerShell multiline commands caused terminal input to be echoed as code
   WORKAROUND: Verify .gitignore manually - run: git show HEAD:.gitignore
   If Ionide section missing, add via: echo ## Ionide >> .gitignore && echo .ionide/ >> .gitignore && echo Ionide.* >> .gitignore

2. Nested Git Repository Structure:
   Two repos detected: outer at root and inner at League-Build-Tool-1.0/
   ACTION: Clarify primary repository structure; may need to consolidate or adjust workflow
   Current status: Working from outer repo (c:\Users\Harry\Desktop\League Build Tool 1.0)

3. MAUI Integration Not Yet Complete:
   Current UI project is Blazor WebAssembly only, not MAUI hybrid
   NEXT STEP: Either create new MAUI shell project (dotnet new maui-blazor) or update existing LeagueBuildTool.UI to MAUI Blazor hybrid
   This is needed for native desktop packaging (Windows/Mac)

4. IDE Warnings in NavMenu.razor:
   NavLink and other components still report namespace errors despite @using directives in Layout
   POSSIBLE FIX: May require explicit @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing in component itself, not just _Imports

CURRENT FILES MODIFIED:
- .gitignore (Ionide entries - may need manual verification/re-add due to shell issue)
- src/LeagueBuildTool.UI/Pages/Studio.razor (NEW - drag-and-drop demo page)
- src/LeagueBuildTool.UI/Layout/NavMenu.razor (added Studio link)
- src/LeagueBuildTool.UI/_Imports.razor (added Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components using)
- src/LeagueBuildTool.UI/wwwroot/css/app.css (added studio styles)

READY FOR TESTING:
Run: cd src/LeagueBuildTool.UI && dotnet watch run
Then navigate to http://localhost:port/studio to see the drag-and-drop design studio in action
